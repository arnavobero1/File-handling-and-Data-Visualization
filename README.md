Few things to note -

There will a few more files that will be uploaded as a part of this project.

The 'filehandling1-checkpoint.ipynb' and 'Excel Visualization-checkpoint.ipynb' must be stored inside a folder named .ipynb_checkpoints which is in the same place as jupyter notebook file.

I have also put an excel file in the Excelcvisualization folder to check the functioning of the program.

Feel free to make pull requests and contributions to it.
